# Fvwm99 - Professional Edition
Fvwm99 is a standalone more focused port of the theme found in my main Fvwm theme engine package, Fvwm-StarterKit(https://github.com/jStimpert0430/fvwm-StarterKit) for those who are only interested in this piece. It is an early windows NT/Windows classic era theme for Fvwm featuring a familiar and easy to use desktop environment with a few additional unique features supported by Fvwm. 

Includes a built in core of the full version of the Fvwm-StarterKit theme engine and carries with it a lot of the same modular dynamic functionality. (Dynamic modules, styling, and colorsets).
