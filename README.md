# Fvwm99
Fvwm99 is a standalone port of the theme found in my main Fvwm theme engine package, Fvwm-StarterKit(https://github.com/jStimpert0430/fvwm-StarterKit). It is a windows NT/Windows classic era theme for Fvwm featuring a familiar and easy to use desktop environment with a few unique Fvwm extra features added for functionality. Includes a built in core of the full version theme engine which carries with it a lot of the same modular dynamic functionality. (Dynamic modules, styling, and colorsets).
